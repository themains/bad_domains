abstract = {As technologies to defend against phishing and malware often impose an additional financial and usability cost on users (such as security keys), a question remains as to who should adopt these heightened protections. We measure over 1.2 billion email-based phishing and malware attacks against Gmail users to understand what factors place a person at heightened risk of attack. We find that attack campaigns are typically short-lived and at first glance indiscriminately target users on a global scale. However, by modeling the distribution of targeted users, we find that a person's demographics, location, email usage patterns, and security posture all significantly influence the likelihood of attack. Our findings represent a first step towards empirically identifying the most at-risk users.},

abstract = {Ransomware has received considerable news coverage in recent years, in part due to several attacks against high-profile corporate targets. Little is known, however, about the prevalence and characteristics of ransomware attacks on the general population, what proportion of users pay, or how users perceive risks and respond to attacks. Using a detailed survey of a representative sample of 1,180 American adults, we estimate that 2\%-3\% of respondents were affected over a 1-year period between 2016 and 2017. The average payment amount demanded was $530 and only a small fraction of affected users (about 4\% of those affected) reported paying. Perhaps surprisingly, cryptocurrencies were typically only one of several payment options, suggesting that they may not be a primary driver of ransomware attacks. We conclude our analysis by developing a simple proof-of-concept method for risk-assessment based on self-reported security habits.},

In this paper, we focus on VirusTotal and its 68 third-party vendors to examine their labeling process on phishing URLs. We perform a series of measurements by setting up our own phishing websites (mimicking PayPal and IRS) and submitting the URLs for scanning. By analyzing the incoming network traffic and the dynamic label changes at VirusTotal, we reveal new insights into how VirusTotal works and the quality of their labels. Among other things, we show that vendors have trouble flagging all phishing sites, and even the best vendors missed 30\% of our phishing sites. In addition, the scanning results are not immediately updated to VirusTotal after the scanning, and there are inconsistent results between VirusTotal scan and some vendors' own scanners. Our results reveal the need for developing more rigorous methodologies to assess and make use of the labels obtained from VirusTotal.},

In this study, we analyzed approximately 43,000 malware download URLs to investigate malware distribution and the behavior of malware download sites over an extended period, i.e., over 1.5 years. We found that some sites survive for a very long time and are revived frequently, a finding not revealed in previous research. By focusing on the malware variation, we have identified three categories of malware download sites, i.e., unchanged, every time changed, changed occasionally. We found that 10% of unchanged sites survived for more than 500 days, and 10% of changed occasionally sites were revived more than 15 times in the entire observation period. We also analyzed sites in terms of IP address changes, anti-virus application results, URL features, and VirusTotal results. We found that each category had different attacker operational and resource characteristics. Finally, based on our findings, we discuss effective countermeasures for each category.},

abstract={ Several previous studies have investigated user susceptibility to phishing attacks. A thorough meta-analysis or systematic review is required to gain a better understanding of these findings and to assess the strength of evidence for phishing susceptibility of a subpopulation, e.g., older users. We aim to determine whether an effect exists; another aim is to determine whether the effect is positive or negative and to obtain a single summary estimate of the effect. OBJECTIVES: We systematically review the results of previous user studies on phishing susceptibility and conduct a meta-analysis. METHOD: We searched four online databases for English studies on phishing. We included all user studies in phishing detection and prevention, whether they proposed new training techniques or analyzed users’ vulnerability. FINDINGS: A careful analysis reveals some discrepancies between the findings. More than half of the studies that analyzed the effect of age reported no statistically significant relationship between age and users’ performance. Some studies reported older people performed better while some reported the opposite. A similar finding holds for the gender difference. The meta-analysis shows: 1) a significant relationship between participants’ age and their susceptibility 2) females are more susceptible than males 3) users training significantly improves their detection ability. },

Unfortunately, it is little known to the end-users how VT URL scanners decide on the maliciousness of entities and the attack types they are involved in (e.g., phishing or malware-hosting websites). In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparative study on VT URL scanners' behavior for different attack types of malicious URLs, in terms of 1) detection specialties, 2) stability, 3) correlations between scanners, and 4) lead/lag behaviors. Our findings highlight that the VT scanners commonly disagree with each other on their detection and attack type classification, leading to challenges in ascertaining the maliciousness of a URL and taking prompt mitigation actions according to different attack types. This motivates us to present a new highly accurate classifier that helps correctly identify the attack types of malicious URLs at the early stage. This in turn assists practitioners in performing better threat aggregation and choosing proper mitigation actions for different attack types},

abstract = {VirusTotal provides malware labels from a large set of anti-malware engines, and is heavily used by researchers for malware annotation and system evaluation. Since different engines often disagree with each other, researchers have used various methods to aggregate their labels. In this paper, we take a data-driven approach to categorize, reason, and validate common labeling methods used by researchers. We first survey 115 academic papers that use VirusTotal, and identify common methodologies. Then we collect the daily snapshots of VirusTotal labels for more than 14,000 files (including a subset of manually verified ground-truth) from 65 VirusTotal engines over a year. Our analysis validates the benefits of threshold-based label aggregation in stabilizing files' labels, and also points out the impact of poorly-chosen thresholds. We show that hand-picked "trusted" engines do not always perform well, and certain groups of engines are strongly correlated and should not be treated independently. Finally, we empirically show certain engines fail to perform in-depth analysis on submitted files and can easily produce false positives. Based on our findings, we offer suggestions for future usage of VirusTotal for data annotation.},

  abstract={This paper aims to develop a theoretical framework to predict susceptibility to cyber-fraud victimhood. A survey was constructed to examine whether personality, socio-demographic characteristics and online routine activities predicted one-off and repeat victimhood of cyber-fraud. Overall, 11,780 participants completed a survey (one-off victims, N = 728; repeat victims = 329). The final saturated model revealed that psychological and socio-demographic characteristics and online routine activities should be considered when predicting victimhood. Consistent with the hypotheses, victims of cyber-frauds were more likely to be older, score high on impulsivity measures of urgency and sensation seeking, score high on addictive measures and engage in more frequent routine activities that place them at great risk of becoming scammed. There was little distinction between one-off and repeat victims of cyber-frauds. This work uniquely combines psychological, socio-demographic and online behaviours to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework to predict susceptibility to cyber-frauds. Importantly, the work here challenges the current utility of government websites to protect users from becoming scammed and provides insights into methods that might be used to protect users from becoming scammed.},

    abstract = {The present article aimed to explore if susceptibility to cybercrime can be linked to information security awareness and personality factors. A total of 1,054 participants aged between 18 and 84 years took part in an online survey consisting of a recently developed segmentation analysis tool designed to explore an individual’s susceptibility to cybercrime. Alongside this, two other scales measuring information security awareness and the personality trait of impulsivity were also included. In total, 60\% of the population surveyed presented as being in the higher risk categories for susceptibility to cybercrime. Furthermore, individuals in the higher risk categories for susceptibility to cybercrime also presented poorer information security awareness, as well as having higher levels of trait impulsivity. It was also noted that certain demographic factors also linked to susceptibility to cybercrime, including age and current employment status, with the unemployed and student populations being less well represented in lower risk categories. This work is seen as being critical while designing effective intervention strategies that are designed to target specific at-risk populations, as well as presenting a key tool that could be widely used by organizations to examine risk within their own specific populations.},

    abstract = {Interest in the individual differences underlying end user computer security behavior has led to the development of a multidisciplinary field of research known as behavioral information security. An important gap in knowledge and the motivation for this research is the development of ways to measure secure and insecure cyber behavior for research and eventually practice. Here we report a study designed to develop a technique for assessing secure and insecure cyber behavior for broad research use. The Susceptibility and Resilience to Cyber Threat (SRCT) is an immersive scenario decision program. The SRCT measures susceptibility to cyber threat and malicious behavior as well protective resilience actions via participant responses/decisions to emails, interactions with security dialogs, and computer actions in a real-world simulation. Data were collected from a sample of 190 adults (76.3% female), between the ages of 18–61 (mean age = 26.12). Personality, behavioral tendencies, and cognitive preferences were measured with standard previously validated protocols and self-report measures. Factor analysis suggested a 5 item secure actions scale and a 9 item insecure actions scale as viable to extract from the SRCT responses. Statistically analyzable distributions of secure and insecure cyber behaviors were obtained, and these subscales demonstrated acceptable internal consistency as hypothesized. Associations between SRCT scales and other indices of cyber behavior, as well as self-reported personality, were lower than predicted, suggesting that past research reporting links between self-reports of personality and self-reported cyber-behavior may be overestimating the links for actual cyber actions. However, our exploratory analyses suggest discrepancies between self-report and actions in the SRCT may be an interesting avenue to explore. Overall, results were consistent with theorizing and suggest the technique is viable as a construct measure in future research or as an outcome variable in experimental intervention designs.},

abstract = {VirusTotal is the largest online anti-malware scanning service. It is widely used by security researchers for labeling malware data or serving as a comparison baseline. However, several important challenges of using VirusTotal are left unaddressed (e.g., whether VirusTotal labels are already stable, when VirusTotal labels can be trusted), severely harming the correctness of research projects depending on VirusTotal.In this paper, we present VTSet, which contains daily VirusTotal labels on more than 14,000 files over one year. VTSet can be used to build and evaluate various tools to tackle the existing challenges and facilitate the usage of VirusTotal. Besides the data, VTSet also provides a demonstration tool to display many measurement results and a query tool to ease the access of its data.

abstract = {Many computer-security defenses are reactive---they operate only when security incidents take place, or immediately thereafter. Recent efforts have attempted to predict security incidents before they occur, to enable defenders to proactively protect their devices and networks. These efforts have primarily focused on long-term predictions. We propose a system that enables proactive defenses at the level of a single browsing session. By observing user behavior, it can predict whether they will be exposed to malicious content on the web seconds before the moment of exposure, thus opening a window of opportunity for proactive defenses. We evaluate our system using three months' worth of HTTP traffic generated by 20,645 users of a large cellular provider in 2017 and show that it can be helpful, even when only very low false positive rates are acceptable, and despite the difficulty of making "on-the-fly'' predictions. We also engage directly with the users through surveys asking them demographic and security-related questions, to evaluate the utility of self-reported data for predicting exposure to malicious content. We find that self-reported data can help forecast exposure risk over long periods of time. However, even on the long-term, self-reported data is not as crucial as behavioral measurements to accurately predict exposure.},

abstract = {Blacklists play a vital role in protecting internet users against phishing attacks. The effectiveness of blacklists depends on their size, scope, update speed and frequency, and accuracy - among other characteristics. In this paper we present a measurement study that analyses 3 key phishing blacklists: Google Safe Browsing (GSB), OpenPhish (OP), and PhishTank (PT). We investigate the uptake, dropout, typical lifetimes, and overlap of URLs in these blacklists. During our 75-day measurement period we observe that GSB contains, on average, 1.6 million URLs, compared to 12,433 in PT and 3,861 in OP. We see that OP removes a significant proportion of its URLs after 5 and 7 days, with none remaining after 21 days - potentially limiting the blacklist’s effectiveness. We observe fewer URLs residing in all 3 blacklists as time-since-blacklisted increases – suggesting that phishing URLs are often short-lived. None of the 3 blacklists enforce a one-time-only URL policy - therefore protecting users against reoffending phishing websites. Across all 3 blacklists, we detect a significant number of URLs that reappear within 1 day of removal – perhaps suggesting premature removal or re-emerging threats. Finally, we discover 11,603 unique URLs residing in both PT and OP – a 12\% overlap. Despite its smaller average size, OP detected over 90\% of these overlapping URLs before PT did.},
