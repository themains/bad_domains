### Bad Domains: Exposure to Malicious Content


Traditional concerns about the digital divide have been exacerbated by concerns about safety. In this paper, using passively observed domain-level browsing data for a month on 1200 Americans from YouGov and data on malicious domains from [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/), we test if the poor, the less educated, the older, or the minorities are more likely to visit malicious websites than their counterparts. 

We find that visits to malicious websites--websites that carry exploits or other malicious artifacts--are highly skewed. The median user visited 2 different websites with malicious content over the month, the 75th percentile visited 5, the 95th percentile 16, and the 99th percentile 27. The bottom line, however, is that more than 75\% of the people online were exposed to malicious content over the month.

The pattern of visits is not explained well by race. Visits across sexes are also balanced. Education matters but the only discernible difference is between people with a postgraduate degree or more and those with less education than that. The median number of different websites with malicious content that people with a postgraduate degree visited was 1 instead of 2 for people with less education than that. Age however shows a striking pattern with the median number of unique websites with malicious content visited by people 65 or over 8 times that of people 25 years or younger.
